# ArUco Marker Detection and Pose Estimation

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to detect ArUco markers using OpenCV and estimate their pose in 3D space. The program also visualizes the detected markers and overlays a 3D cube on them to showcase pose estimation.

## Features
- Detect ArUco markers of various predefined dictionaries.
- Estimate the pose (position and orientation) of detected markers.
- Overlay a 3D cube on detected markers for visualization.
- Supports real-time video input from a camera.
